                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>My name is Matthew Wisner, I'm a Private First Class and Data Systems Administrator in the Marine Corps Reserves. I've been a Marine for little over a year now, and experienced the bulk of my training at Twentynine Palms USMC base here in California! I have a strong interest in computer science and look to expand my knowledge with every opportunity I come across.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>More about my MOS (Military Occupational Speciality)</h4>
                <p>My current reserve station is located in San Bruno, CA, where I go for 2-4 days once every month according to a set schedule. I am part of the S-6 platton and work with other communications and cyber marines. Activities pertaining to my specifc MOS would usually involve the managing of active directories, creation of user accounts, creation of group policies, and other related tasks.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Does this job conflict with other pursuits?</h4>
                <p>Because of my military duties, any other job I have has to accomodate my drill schedule. I am only required to show up to my duty station ONCE A MONTH for no longer than 2-4 DAYS. That is to say, with consideration and planning in advance, I have plenty of time to puruse other forms of employment. Also to note: this current fiscal year's schedule has been made avaliable to me, allowing any potential employer to view it on demand.</p>
